[![](http://blog.herdingtigers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/tigerheadonly3.jpg)](http://blog.herdingtigers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/tigerheadonly3.jpg)I had no idea what I was about to experience at [Los Angeles Ruby Conference 2009 (LARubyConf)](http://www.larubyconf.com/) when [Danny Blitz](http://blog.herdingtigers.com/) took the podium as the next presenter. I had seen him hanging out with his distinctive pompadour, tattoos, and leather jacket. He is a big guy, and hard to miss. But he had been pretty quiet till then, which was about to change radically.  
  
Herding Cats is a term commonly used when describing the management of software teams. But when Danny Blitz says cats, he means big cats aka tigers. So who is this guy? He has done TONS of stuff, from DOD to Dell, to the DARPA autonomous vehicle challenge. Very cool stuff.  
  
Get Agility?  
  
"A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week" - Patton  
  
Q. Why is software so difficult?  
A. We don't want to face the truth  
  
Q. Why don't we want to face the truth?  
A. We're afraid  
  
Q. What are we afraid of?  
A. We're afraid we do not know anything about end result  
  
Q. How can we deal with this?  
A. Admit the truth  
  
A tiger team is a small self improving team.  
  
What can you expect from a tiger team?  
Their first project was scheduled to take 5 weeks - took 5 days  
  
TIGERS ARE A TEAM!  
  
QA is part of tiger team  
  
Tigers show leadership  
  
Tigers self-improve  
  
Almost no meetings on a tiger team  
  
QA and test automation are the tip of the spear  
  
QA should be there from very beginning  
  
Shared psychology and intelligence  
  
Winning, boldness, excellence  
  
Not afraid of the dark

There are two kinds of warfare: attrition and maneuver  
  
Attrition warefare  
\- traditional, tactical  
\- clashing head-on  
  
Maneuver warfare

Speed  
\- it is a competitive weapon  
\- undeniable advantage in business  
  
Speed mitigates risk

Speed improves the team  
  
Speed adds to job satisfaction  
  
Speed allows agile to function properly  
\- max iteration length (usually 30 days)  
  
Speed builds credibility  
\- shows a lot of work in short order  
  
Cows and tigers  
\- cow is bigger, but who wins?  
  
Disease: using agile terms to describe non-agile project  
  
Corporate animal kingdom  
\- Tiger

"Tiger teams are like Hell's Programmers" - Danny Blitz  
  
Leadership  
this is what makes or breaks  
faith  
love  
hope  
success belongs to the team  
failure belongs to the leader  
buck stops here  
fearlessness  
listener and learner  
protector  
outside influences  
internally too  
team members themselves  
  
US marine management techniques  
\- manage by end state and intent  
\- reward failure  
\- demand to be questoned  
\- glorify the lower levels of organization  
  
Politeness and professionalism  
\- that or poison  
  
Agile is not a methodology, it is a mindset, it is inevitable  
  
Danny says he is working on the book called "Herding Tigers". He has also started a blog at [herdingtigers.com](http://blog.herdingtigers.com). All I can say is, he is a very dynamic and exciting speaker. Everyone was captivated, myself included. I'm still not sure how I took these notes.  
  
Rock on, Danny!
