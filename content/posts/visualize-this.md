[![](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/periodic-table-of-visualization-methods.png)](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/periodic-table-of-visualization-methods.png)Did you ever want to present information in a visual format, but didn't know which one was most appropriate? Don't know a Petri net from a concept fan? Or perhaps you just need even more visual stimulus from your information?  
  
Well, welcome to a feast of visualization splendor. Just have a glance at the [Periodic Table of Visualization Methods](http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html)... your eyes will never go hungry again.  
  
Thanks to [Visual Literacy](http://www.visual-literacy.org/) for creating this great info, and to Jeff Atwood of [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com) for blogging about it.
