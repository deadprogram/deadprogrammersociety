[![](http://www.kabbalah.com/k/images/72namessml.gif)](http://www.kabbalah.com/k/images/72namessml.gif)I have just released a new update of [Hebruby](http://rubyforge.org/projects/hebruby/), the Ruby hebrew date conversion library. It is now available as a proper Ruby gem, and has much improved documentation. If your Rails application needs to convert from julian date to a hebrew date, or from a hebrew date to a julian date, or display a date in hebrew (either in hebrew or transliterated into english) this gem is for you.  
To install it, just:  
```
  
gem install hebruby  

```  
Thank you to everyone who has helped with Hebruby, especially [Joshua Harvey](http://shnoo.gr/), and enjoy!
