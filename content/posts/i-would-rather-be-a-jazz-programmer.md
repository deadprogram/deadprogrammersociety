[![](http://www.bigbaer.com/assets/jimmy-smith-hammond-b3-jazz-legend.jpg)](http://www.bigbaer.com/assets/jimmy-smith-hammond-b3-jazz-legend.jpg)I have reading a bit lately about "rockstar" programmers. Recruiter ads are proclaiming "Rockstar programmer needed". Various websites named rockstar<name of technology> or alternately <name of technology>rockstars are springing up everywhere.  
  
I would rather be a "jazz musician" programmer, myself. Nothing against rock, don't get me wrong. Glam, punk, metal, I can go there. I frequently do. It's the "star" part, that has been starting to bother me.  
  
Here are some differences, as I see them:  
  
**Rockstar**  
\- One big hit song, then disappears  
\- Embarrass themselves as they age  
\- Claims they wrote the song  
\- Keeps trying to get back that sound they used to have  
\- Gets back together with the old band after unsuccessful solo careers  
\- Wants to marry a model and have a movie cameo  
\- Won't play without a contract and advance payment  
  
**Jazzer**  
\- One big hit, and they become an influence  
\- Get cooler with age  
\- Claims the song is just a cool arrangement of a standard  
\- Keeps trying to produce a new sound  
\- Records with a variety of musicians over time  
\- Wants to become a professor at Berkeley School of Music  
\- Jams on the street corner just because they feel like it
