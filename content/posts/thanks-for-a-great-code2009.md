[![](http://edibleink.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/champagne2-1.jpg)](http://edibleink.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/champagne2-1.jpg)It has been an amazing year for both personal and professional code development.  
  
Starting with the inspiration to begin [Project Flying Robot](http://flyingrobo.com), to the prestige of presenting at [LARubyConf](http://www.larubyconf.com/), [FutureRuby](http://futureruby.com/), [TWTRCON](http://twtrcon.com/), [IgniteLA](http://ignite.oreilly.com/), [140 The Twitter Conference](http://parnassusgroup.com/twitterconference/), [RubyConf](http://www.rubyconf.org/), and [Conferencia Rails](http://www.conferenciarails.org/), and lastly the year-end fun of starting out the ongoing [#code2009](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23code2009) Twitter meme, so popular that it spawned a couple of mashups and got picked up by [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1023432) and uber-language blog [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3749).  
  
In between were numerous meetups, hackfests, code jams, code dojos, pull requests, and casual codeslinging with friends. And the [Maker Faire](http://www.makerfaire.com/)!  
  
To everyone who welcomed me, listened to me, helped me, or taught me something, I am indeed grateful. Thank you. Let's do this 2010 thing right!
