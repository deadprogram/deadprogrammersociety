[![](http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/06/iss.jpg)](http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/06/iss.jpg)I was shocked to read about the [ongoing problems with the life support computers onboard the International Space Station](http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/14/critical-space-station-computers-fail/). Every time I hear of problems up there, I feel a serious rant coming on.  
  
I grew up on science fiction books. In fact, I would have to say that the vast majority of my childhood was spent far away from this planet. Suffice to say, I am a serious supporter of space exploration.  
  
But this madness with the ISS is about more than I can take. Between the [noise](http://www.space-travel.com/reports/New_Effort_To_Reduce_Noise_On_Space_Station_999.html), the [need to keep reboosting its orbit](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17630218/), and the [lack of any real scientific value](http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10614&page=3), we really SHOULD abandon ship at this point!
