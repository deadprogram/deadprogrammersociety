[![](http://www.ionsgarage.com/site/gfx/levitate2.jpg)](http://www.ionsgarage.com/site/gfx/levitate2.jpg)As usual, human ingenuity has raised science to a new height. In this case, a very small height, but let us not quibble about a few details. [UK researchers have discovered a way to circumvent the Casimir force](http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2195701/scientists-crack-levitation), which is what causes very small things to clump together. By using a clever type of lens, the researchers were able to reverse the Casimir force in their experiment.  
  
Despite the fun headlines, this does not mean [repulsors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man's_armor) for the masses. Any practical application would likely be amazing new manufacturing techniques for nano-tech materials, and new types of nano-devices, not flying cars at this point. More like nano-engines that are more efficient due to reducing friction by "floating" the components of the device together.  
  
At the very least, this should spawn a new outbreak of copycat [perpetual motion machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_perpetual_motion_machines) and the like...
