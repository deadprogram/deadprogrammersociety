[![](http://www.makershed.com/v/vspfiles/photos/mkca1-2.jpg)](http://www.makershed.com/v/vspfiles/photos/mkca1-2.jpg)As [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/) approached, [my brother Damen](http://myfirstairship.blogspot.com/) and I were very busy working on something cool: support for the [now-shipping Blimpduino kit!](http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=mkca1)  
  
Thanks to the tireless efforts of Chris Anderson and Jordi Mu√±oz, the long awaited [Blimpduino](http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A44817) kit is now shipping at [Makershed](http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=mkca1). As readers of this blog know, we have drawn a lot of inspiration from the Blimpduino. Now, we actually have 2 of them, and you can get your own. For less than $100, plus a few other items, and [flying\_robot](http://github.com/deadprogrammer/flying_robot/tree/master) software of course, you have everything you need for a complete experimenters kit for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles at home.  
  
There are a few mods you need to make to your Blimpduino, if you want to be cool like us, and control/reprogram it using a linked pair of XBee modems. We will post complete directions soon on how to mod your blimpduino into a [flying\_robot](http://github.com/deadprogrammer/flying_robot/tree/master) using [Ruby Arduino Development](http://rad.rubyforge.org/).  
  
In the meantime, you can look at the almost completed [flying\_robot for Blimpduino code here](http://github.com/deadprogrammer/flying_robot_blimpduino/tree/master).
