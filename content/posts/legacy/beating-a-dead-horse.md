This is quite emblematic of what dead programmers see every day, as we are often ordered to ride dead horses...  
  
We need to add a couple to the list:  
  
\- Offshore the dead horse so we can ride it 24 hours a day  
\- Mandate all riding be done on site, so we can keep an eye on our dead horse
