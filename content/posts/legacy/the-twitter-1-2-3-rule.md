I just had a small realization: there is a perfect ratio for Twitter use. Wait, before you laugh and hit the back button, hear me out on the following idea.  
  
There is an emergent trend in optimal Twitter use:  
```
  
If you have X followers,  
You should have 2X people that YOU follow  
And have made 3X updates  

```  
Get it? Twitter 1-2-3. Nice simple rule...  
  
Here is what is means if these ratios are out of whack:  

  
*   Less then 2X people that you follow = who do you think you are, Shaq?
  
*   More than 2X people that you follow = perhaps you should do something besides Twitter?
  
*   Less then 3X updates = why are so many people following you?
  
*   More than 3x updates = you really like to listen to yourself, don't you?
