I was forwarded a link to the original, left on the cutting room floor ending of the Roger Corman classic horror film ["Little Shop of Horrors"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054033/) and not only was it a timely tidbit for Halloween, but it was also strangely appropriate for the election.  
  
Enjoy your candy...
