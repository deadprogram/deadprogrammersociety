I read a great posting last night from Matt Rogers, founder of startup Aroxo, on a [strategy for usability testing](http://www.aroxo.com/blog/mattr/index.php/2008/02/14/how-to-test-your-system-with-real-users). Suddenly, I was flashing back a few years to the early salad days of web usability...  
  
When I first read [Steve Krug's](http://www.sensible.com/) tiny masterwork ["Don't Make Me Think"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321344758/ref=nosim/advancedcommonse), I was very excited; at last, a nice practical approach! After the pedantic and overly academic work of guys like Jakob Neilson, Krug's book hit me like Dr. Seuss taking out Dick, Jane, and Spot.  
  
Somehow, Rogers' post reminded me of that sudden flash of clarity in the fog. Yes, we can DO this! Gentlemen and ladies, start your testing...
