[![](http://www.mcmenamins.com/shop/pix/patch.ruby.jpg)](http://www.mcmenamins.com/shop/pix/patch.ruby.jpg)Portland has good beer. There, now I've said it. One of the key benefits of holding the [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/) conference in Portland has to be easily obtaining really good beer.  
  
The [McMenamins on Broadway](http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=32) is the closest place to the convention center to go where "Classics such as raspberry-tinged Ruby, medium-bodied Hammerhead and dark, strong Terminator Stout are always available."  
  
In between the fun of learning all about [Rails 2.0](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_spkr/2130), [Capistrano 2.0](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/12191), [scalability](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/11694), [more scalability](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/11684), [still more scalability](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/11439), let us not forget to take the time to drink a really good beer together! Or more than one, perhaps...
