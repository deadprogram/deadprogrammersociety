So now it is official. The [latest build](http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2007/03/jruby-098-is-here.html) from the [JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/) team is now running Ruby on Rails in the JRuby runtime. Great work from that team! The Sunsters up top must be gloating right now.  
  
And Microsoft is still MIA. Despite some hopeful signs of life, the silence is deafening from Ray Ozzie and the .NET camp (is that a band?). MS had better have some damn strong announcement at [MIX](http://www.visitmix.com/) vis-Ã -vis [Ruby.NET](http://plas.fit.qut.edu.au/ruby.net/) or some [top secret John Lam project](http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2007/02/12/microsoft-and-grad-school-part-2) if they want to stay in the game.  
  
In the meantime, I still think that [YARV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YARV) will be the runtime for me, based on [sheer performance](http://www.antoniocangiano.com/articles/2007/02/19/ruby-implementations-shootout-ruby-vs-yarv-vs-jruby-vs-gardens-point-ruby-net-vs-rubinius-vs-cardinal) alone. Not to mention that is now part of the Ruby SVN tree.
