I saw this [very interesting robot](http://www.newscientisttech.com/article.ns?id=dn11238&feedId=online-news_rss20) today. Not only can it [crawl](http://www.isi.edu/robots/superbot/movies/Feb2007/beach-caterpillar.wmv), [shimmy](http://www.isi.edu/robots/superbot/movies/Feb2007/ropeclimber.wmv), [roll](http://www.isi.edu/robots/superbot/movies/Feb2007/rollingtrack1.wmv), and [walk](http://www.isi.edu/robots/superbot/movies/Feb2007/walker1.wmv), but it does so by combining a small group of autonomous, modular, self-reconfiguring bots that operate together as a unit. Very cool!  
  
Transformers, indeed. Have I mentioned that I want a set of [Lego Mindstorms NXT](http://mindstorms.lego.com) for my birthday? I would love to mess around with [ruby-nxt](http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-nxt/) or the [Microsoft Robotics Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/).
