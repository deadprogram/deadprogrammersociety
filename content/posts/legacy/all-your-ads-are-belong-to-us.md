Charter Communications is the first major ISP to begin seriously abusing their role as telecommunications provider. How so? As Lauren Weinstein puts it:  
  

> Greetings. Charter Communications has now announced that they intend to "wiretap" (that's the only appropriate term I can think of) subscribers' Internet Communications, and use the search data obtained in this manner to inject Charter's own targeted advertising into user data streams.

  
  
Let's fall back on a real-world telecommunications example. You have made a call to a business to get information from them. You get thru, and are then put on hold. While you are on hold, suddenly a recording from a competitor of the company that you called starts playing, saying "press 0 to do business with us instead".  
  
Wouldn't company 1 be pretty upset, and justifiably so? Especially if it was their telecommunications provider who was listening in on their call, and trying to "steal their customer."  
  
How about another commercial example? You are talking to your friend. Every time they try to say the word "Starbucks" in conversation, the word "McDonalds" is substituted, as in "I really liked going to X this weekend".  
  
How would either of you even know that this had happened?
