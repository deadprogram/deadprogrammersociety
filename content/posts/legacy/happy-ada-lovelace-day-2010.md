Once again, it is [Lady Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) day, and time for me to celebrate some women software developers that I know personally. This year I want to call out four women that I have especially noticed their knowledge and dedication. In no particular order...  
  
First, a big shout out to Sarah Mei ([@sarahmei](http://twitter.com/sarahmei)). Sarah is a founder of [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to helping people learn about and make use of Ruby on Rails. She is also a conference speaker who has been going around hyping up the community about one of the subjects most near and dear to my heart: teaching kids programming.  
  
Next, a special thanks to Sonia Ramirez, my colleague at [our Los Angeles based software development consultancy The Hybrid Group](http://hybridgroup.com). Sonia is a tireless and detail oriented software developer. She is always eager to learn, and brings a great sense of humor to all of her work with us.  
  
Third, a special thanks to [Andrea O.K. Wright](http://www.chariotsolutions.com/). Andrea has been a very active member of the Ruby community, and has given a number of presentations, must recently an incredibly ambitious overview of NoSQL databases at RubyConf 2009.  
  
And rounding out this small sampling of the XX chromosome-based programming talent, is a new acquaintance Sarah Allen ([@ultrasaurus](http://twitter.com/ultrasaurus)). Sarah is also involved with the RailsBridge project, and is a mobile software developer who has published several projects based on the [Rhodes](http://rhomobile.com/) framework. She is also a conference speaker, and published the RubyConf mobile application that we all made use of at [LARubyConf](http://www.larubyconf.com/) earlier this year.  
  
These persons of the female gender are merely a small sampling of the awesomeness that exists within the Ruby community. They just happen to be ladies that I have either worked with, or benefited from their contributions directly.  
  
Thank you all, and have a great Ada Lovelace Day. And get back to some coding!
