It has been very overdue to get [Frankie](http://github.com/deadprogrammer/frankie/tree/master) updated to work with the latest versions of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Facebooker](http://github.com/mmangino/facebooker/tree/master).  
  
But where I have been lagging, [mjfreshyfresh](http://blog.stepchangegroup.com/) has stepped up, and submitted a patch that gives compatibility with Sinatra 0.9.x and Facebooker 1.0.2. Thanks, my main man!  
  
The Frankie gem has been updated to version 0.3, and it is available at your convenience. Note that you really do appear to need the 1.0.2 version of Facebooker for this release. Make sure you install facebooker using -v=1.0.2 to get only that version.  
  
Let's all go huge on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com)!
