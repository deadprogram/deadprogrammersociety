I do not often pay full attention to [Giles Bowkett](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/). That is the flip side of being the provocateur that he is, some people will occasionally tune out. However, when anyone plays the [Steve Krug](http://www.sensible.com/) card, I am compelled to take a look.  
  
Yesterday, Giles posted a dead-on point about user registration, called ["I Don't Care About Your Hoops"](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-dont-care-about-your-hoops.html). When you compare the success of simplicity, as in the Google and Apple examples, to what we all tend to fall into, I hope you are as embarrassed as I was. Time for some self-examination.  
  
I was ready to hack down the user signup process to size. Here are my new rules:  

  
*   4 or more registration steps = FAIL
  
*   3 registration steps = A long shot, but you might make it
  
*   2 registration steps = At the top of the key, worth taking a shot, but no sure thing
  
*   1 registration step = A free throw, you should easily sink it
  
*   0 registration steps = Slamdunk ala Michael Jordan. Ain't no stopping us now.
