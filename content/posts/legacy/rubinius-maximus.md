[![](http://www.peplums.info/images/39rome/39g01.jpg)](http://www.peplums.info/images/39rome/39g01.jpg)I got a little excited when I read of the [team assembled right now working on Rubinius](http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/12/05/the-new-rubinius-team) up at Engine Yard in San Francisco.  
  
After following the Ruby VM coopitition for while, and then seeing the [Rubinius crew in full effect at RubyConf 2007](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/11/rubyconf-2007-day-2-ruby-vm-smackdown.html), I am more convinced than ever that we are going to see some SERIOUS code coming out of these guys.... and assembling them all in one place is the best way to do it. Props to Engine Yard for making it happen. Get the throne ready, because the inheritors of the Ruby Imperium cometh.  
  
Hail, Rubinius!
