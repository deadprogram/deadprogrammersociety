[![](http://www.kissfaq.com/tours/kiss_pctour2.jpg)](http://www.kissfaq.com/tours/kiss_pctour2.jpg)As usual, no blog posts = a lot of other activity here at Flying Robot HQ. Among other personal stuff, my brother [Damen Evans](http://twitter.com/damenevans) and I have been getting ready for the last public demos of [@flyingrobot](http://twitter.com/flyingrobot) for 2009. And we are going out with style!  
  
Later this week, we roll up to San Francisco to present at the prestigious [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org)! Then, next week @flyingrobot and I will fly off to Madrid, Spain, to do our first European appearance at the awesome-looking [Conferencia Rails](http://www.conferenciarails.org/).  
  
Anyhow, if you have been waiting eagerly for more Flying Robot news and gadgets, be patient. We will be unveiling our mysterious cool new stuff in just a few days...
