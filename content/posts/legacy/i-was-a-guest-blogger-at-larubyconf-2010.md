[![](http://jeanonjean.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/reporter-the-philadelphia-story.jpg)](http://jeanonjean.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/reporter-the-philadelphia-story.jpg)Longtime readers of this blog know that I can really get into writing about Ruby conferences, and I had a great time this last weekend at [LARubyConf 2010](http://larubyconf.com). This time, I got to try some thing new: I was guest blogging the conference for [TheBitSource](http://www.thebitsource.com), which has been providing some great coverage of other tech events like [PyCon](http://www.pycon.org/) and [SCALE](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org).  
  
[Please check out my complete recap from the 2nd annual Los Angeles Ruby Conference LARubyConf 2010 here](http://www.thebitsource.com/tech-conferences/larubyconf-2010-a-ruby-in-the-sun/). And thanks!
