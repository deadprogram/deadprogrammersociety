[![](http://www.craphound.com/images/masqueromovie.jpg)](http://www.craphound.com/images/masqueromovie.jpg)I just registered for RubyConf 2007, which will be held Nov. 2-4 in Charlotte, NC. If you want a more intimate, more hard-core Rubyist experience, than what RailsConf is turning into, RubyConf looks to be it.  
  
There not being that many tickets available, you better [register](http://www.regonline.com/Checkin.asp?EventId=145820) right now if you want to go. I registered without even looking at the agenda first... just filled out the registration form, and hoped it's was not too late.  
  
Once I has nervously typed my credit card info, and gotten my email confirmation, I took a few breaths. and got around to checking out the schedule for the conference I had just committed to attending. I was not disappointed.  
  
Lo and behold, the ultimate battle of the Ruby VM's will be taking place on Saturday, Nov. 3. Take a peek at what's in store:  
  
9:00A - John Lam - State of IronRuby  
10:00A - Charlie Nutter - JRuby: Ruby for the JVM  
11:00A - Evan Phoenix - Rubinius 1.0  
  
Wow! If you care at all about the future of Ruby as a language, not just as a vehicle for fevered dreams of Ruby on Rails-based world-domination, you can't help but get excited. The three ascendants to the throne of dynamic language glory, all duking it out in a back-to-back 3-hour frenzy. Yum!  
  
Improving the language performance of Ruby is the big thing needed to push out all those other wanna-be next big languages into the dustbin of interesting languages that no one uses. I think Erlang is really neat, don't get me wrong, but one look at that syntax, and sugar is not what comes to mind!
