Recently at The Hybrid Group, we started thinking about the whole idea of code reviews. But first of all, a brief review of the word "review". People often use the word review in a judgmental context. When referring to a book review, we expect an opinion about if our time and money are worth spending on reading a particular book. A "salary review" is a kind of judgement to be passed where there is also a critical economic impact to the opinion expressed by the reviewer. The less-pejorative usage of the word review, which is to "get familiar with a thing", is not a threat enough for us usually to consider this context when we say "code review". I recently hit up the Twitterverse for opinions, facts, and fancies regarding code review. There were a few interesting patterns that emerged, which I would like to share.
