Believe it or not, this posting really is about DJing aka mixing music. Those who know me well are familiar with my alter-ego DJ KRON. I have been a proponent of digital DJing for years, even since I got my first Denon CD DJ setup around 1997. I switched to being a Traktor user for a number of years, and have put togther a half-dozen or so compilations using Traktor, which really is an amazing piece of software.  
  
However, since I switched back to the Mac, I needed to switch to some OS X DJ software. My first reaction was to simply upgrade to the latest Traktor, but I discovered that the open source community has been busy working on the needs of broke-ass DJ's, as far as providing a decent solution.  
  
Enter Mixxx, which is an open-source project running on Windows, Ubuntu, and OS X. after a few false starts, I have gotten it working rather well with my Griffin iMic. For anyone who has ever tried and failed to setup a proper monitoring/playback with their iMic, it works great and is simple as can be... once you know what to do.  
  
It does lack quite a bit compared to Traktor, but they have made amazing progress, and are about to release the 1.6 version. If you are interested at all in digital DJing, check it out!
