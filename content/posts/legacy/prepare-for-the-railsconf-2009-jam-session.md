I will be [running the music BOF](http://chadfowler.com/2009/2/8/one-more-week-for-railsconf-proposals) at [RailsConf 2009](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/) in Las Vegas. What does that mean? We're gonna get down. All styles will be represented, so if you have an instrument or a voice, bring it.  
  
We have a Google group started [here](http://groups.google.ca/group/jazz-at-railsconf).
