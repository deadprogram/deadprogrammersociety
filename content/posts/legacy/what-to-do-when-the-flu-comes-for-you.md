[![](http://www.sfcdcp.org/UserFiles/Image/avian_flu_virus.jpg)](http://www.sfcdcp.org/UserFiles/Image/avian_flu_virus.jpg)My dear friend and former colleague Dan Rasmus has some really important points to make regarding IT operations and emergency preparedness in his blog entry [Work Interrupted - Rapid Response in a Crisis](http://future-of-work.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!C07907DBA0E3BEA6!482.entry).  
  
Thank about how many warnings we have already had about [potential pandemics](http://www.pandemicflu.gov/). If it hits, it will be too late to make emergency plans...we will need to be carrying out those plans, not talking about what they should be!  
  
I have a supply of masks, gloves, bottled water and canned food at my home. Do you? I hope I never need them...but I have them.
