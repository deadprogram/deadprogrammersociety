[![](http://www.rubyclr.com/images/header-logo.jpg)](http://www.rubyclr.com/images/header-logo.jpg)I am still overwhelmed with excitement about the big news that John Lam, creator of [RubyCLR](http://www.rubyclr.com/) has accepted a full time job with Microsoft. John's blog has the details [here](http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2006/10/20/dynamic-languages-microsoft-and-me).  
MS had already jumped into dynamic languages with the acquisition of IronPython. Now it only a matter of time until "Ruby#" or whatever MS will call it (since there is already a Ruby.NET project, which is heading in yet another direction). \*nix purists and MS haters may be cringing, but I think it quite legitimizes the Ruby meme to naysayers who may have thought Ruby was just a fad.  
  
Working in the big corporate space, one of the primary objections that I have encountered to implementing systems written in the Ruby language, is needing to run on Windows and use existing complex .NET services that are already deployed in the enterprise. A Ruby coming from Microsoft, on top of a Ruby coming from Sun ([JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/)), just sends a clear message to corporate types that "This Ruby thing is real". Heh. Heh heh, even.  
  
Many of us have been trying to get Ruby taken seriously for a while, and this is exactly the kind of ammo that dead programmers need to not just sneak Ruby in, but storm the castle walls! Ruby will rule!
