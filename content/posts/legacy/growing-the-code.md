Kevin Barnes over at [Code Craft](http://codecraft.info/) has a cool posting [comparing software development to gardening](http://codecraft.info/index.php/archives/82/). I agree with him that it is a fantastic analogy!  
  
It really rings true to me in a couple of fun ways:  

  
*   Gardening cannot be done once and for ever. It takes constant work to keep it both healthy and tidy.
  
*   There is a big difference in both purpose and aesthetics within different gardens. Consider a [typical traditional backyard garden](http://www.evergreensuk.com/images/circle-lawn04.jpg) vs. [Noguchi Gardens](http://www.noguchi.org/cascen.htm). Or a [small family farm](http://images.worldofstock.com/slides/TAU4006.jpg) vs. a [large industrial combine](http://www.monolithic.com/gallery/industrial/farm/farm02x.jpg). Each is in theory intended to fulfill a similar purpose, but does so in radically different ways.
  
*   Some people seem to have a knack for gardening, while others cannot help but kill even a hardy plant. And of course, the only way to tell if a gardener is any good, is to look at some gardens they have tended recently.
  

  
The problem with applying any real-world analogy to a virtual thing, is it will inevitably fall apart at some point. But this one is pretty sturdy at first glance.
