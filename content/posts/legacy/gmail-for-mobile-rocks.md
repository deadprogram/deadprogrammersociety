I just installed the brand new [Gmail for Mobile](http://www.gmail.com/app) on my Motorola RAZR. In just a matter of a couple moments, I was looking at my Gmail inbox! Gmail for Mobile is a Java-applet that runs on your Java enabled phone. Keeping the network traffic down this way is a lot better option that a WAP-based email solution, which is what I had tried and abandoned previously.

  

Not having a QWERTY keyboard is a big limitation for smartphones especially where something heavily textual like email is concerned. Gmail for Mobile deals with this thru a clever mapping of hotkeys to the most commonly used functions (delete, in my case).

Between [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com), and now this Gmail for Mobile, another bit of my online existence has been sucked into the Googlesphere...and I like it!
