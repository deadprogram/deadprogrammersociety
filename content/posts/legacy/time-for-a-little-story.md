Brian Marick has a great example of [how to break a software feature up into user stories](http://www.testing.com/writings/small-stories.pdf).  
  
Note how looking at smaller units of granularity make it so much easier to understand, then just trying to identify an entire feature all at once.  
  
Also note how much value even the simplest pictures add to the stories. However, a picture is not enough. I personally love to see [video of the whiteboard conversations for documenting the user stories](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/01/people-are-communicating-beings.html).
