A non-scientific, but clearly well thought-out back-of-envelope calculation by MIT CS professor Philip Greenspun is food for thought: [the cost of replacing the entire fleet of U.S. passenger cars with electric ones would be zero](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2008/05/27/cost-of-converting-entire-us-to-electric-cars-zero/).  
  
Here are some of his numbers:  

>   
> \* total spent per year: $1 trillion  
> \* percentage of oil consumed by passenger cars: 40  
> \* total spent per year on oil for passenger cars: $400 billion \[refining into gasoline, distributing, and retailing add even more to this\]  
> \* at 5 interest, how much we could we borrow and pay $400 billion every year in interest: $8 trillion  
> \* number of registered cars in the U.S.: 250 million (Wikipedia)  
> \* cost of a new electric car, if mass-produced: $20,000  
> \* value of a used car, if exported to Latin America or China: $5,000  
> \* cost to upgrade average existing American car to a brand-new electric car: $15,000  
> \* number that could be converted for $8 trillion: more than 500 million cars (i.e., twice as many as we have now)  

  
And then here is the money quote:  
  

>   
> Instead of sending $400 billion each year to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, we could spend it on electric car production in the U.S., Mexico, and China. At current oil prices, it wouldnâ€™t cost us a dime extra to stop importing and burning oil for passenger cars. In fact, if the goal were to end up with the same number of cars on the road, we would have a few trillion dollars left over. One or two trillion dollars would be sufficient to build nuclear, solar, or wind electric power plants to replace all of our plants that currently burn coal and oil (note that less than 1 percent of current electricity generation in the U.S. is from oil).  

  
  
Now THAT is what I talking about! Let's get on it people... and let's do better than just paying interest only on the bill while we are at it.
