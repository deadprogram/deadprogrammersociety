The annual frenzy of registration for [RailsConf 2008](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home) has begun.  
  
Yes, I have already received my registration confirmation. No, I have not received my speaker confirmation...yet? Oh well, looks like RejectConf again!  
  
See you all there... ahem, not all of you, unless you register right now!
