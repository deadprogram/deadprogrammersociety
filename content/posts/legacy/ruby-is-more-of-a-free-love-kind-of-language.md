[![](http://files.blog-city.com/files/aa/2370/p/f/hippies.gif)](http://files.blog-city.com/files/aa/2370/p/f/hippies.gif)I have been really, really busy lately, which is why I have not had a chance to post anything. I finally caught up on some reading and listening, and [John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/), father of the IronRuby project at Microsoft, has a [fun interview](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=254) on the [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) podcast. Irrespective of how I may currently feel about the [direction over at Microsoft](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/06/microsoft-vs-galaxy.html) or [rock](http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/05/i-would-rather-be-jazz-programmer.html), it is an interesting interview.  
  
My favorite line has to be where John is describing the cultural differences between the users of Python vs. Ruby programming languages. "Ruby is more of a free love kind of language," he says.  
  
I guess when they say that they have drunk the Ruby kool-aid over at Microsoft, they really mean it. But will they wake up hungover and pregnant with a baby they will name "Moonbeam"?
