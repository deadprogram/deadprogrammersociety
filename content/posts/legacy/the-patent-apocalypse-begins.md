[![](http://www.filmreference.com/images/sjff_03_img1340.jpg)](http://www.filmreference.com/images/sjff_03_img1340.jpg)Software patents... as, Obi-Wan warned, "You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious." Well, the dark side has struck back, people. A massive salvo has been launched, this time aimed directly at the open source community in the form of [Trend Micro vs. Barracuda Networks](http://www.linux.com/feature/125807).  
  
I was thinking about a cute little pictograph that would describe the public awareness and attitudes about software patents. Yes, this is highly unscientific. Also, I was too lazy to do it, so I settled for pie charts instead:

75% - Huh? Pass the beer...  
24% - I know ALL about software patents... shoes, right?  
1% - Programmers & Patent Lawyers

Within the programmers and patent lawyers, we could break it down this way:  
75% - I don't mess with them, they don't mess with me... please don't hurt me...  
24% - Ban the patent!  
1% - Sue me? Sue you!  
  
Is that last group now large enough to start the patent apocalypse? Just like any conflagration, some small sparks can result in a firestorm with devastating consequences.  
  
Just ask yourself... really... are the ideas of free open source software and software patents compatible in any way? Are these two not overdue for a showdown? And what if we lose?  
  
Be afraid... be very afraid...
