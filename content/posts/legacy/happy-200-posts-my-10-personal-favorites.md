[![](http://kedarvideo.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/47000-candles.jpg)](http://kedarvideo.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/47000-candles.jpg)I was shocked to discover this morning that this is to be my 200th blog post. Wow! It has been a good run so far since I restarted the Dead Programmer Society in 2006, and I really appreciate the awesome feedback and support that I have received from the community.
