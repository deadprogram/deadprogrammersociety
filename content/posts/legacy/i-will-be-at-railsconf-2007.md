[![](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/images/rails2007/layout/railsConf-logo.gif)](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/images/rails2007/layout/railsConf-logo.gif)I just checked my email, and saw that registration has just opened for [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/). I went to last year's conference, and it was the most interesting and exciting event in the software industry I had been to in years!  
  
If you are interested in going, I suggest that you register immediately. Last year's event sold out in a couple days. When they added 100 additional spots last year, those sold out in hours!  
  
This year's is looking to be even more amazing...be there, or spend all your time reading blogs to figure out what happened!
