It is with great excitement that I want to tell all of you about the first annual [Los Angeles Ruby Conference](http://www.larubyconf.com). Thanks to the fine efforts of a bunch of [LA's hardworking Rubyists](http://www.laruby.com/), and the generous financial support of AT&T Interactive, we are preparing to bring the noise to Los Angeles on April 4, 2009.  
  
Too many of these wannabe cities have been smoking us with their regional conferences, but no more! Time for we Angelinos to step up and be counted among the world's important Ruby communities. All joking aside, it really is time for us to share our enthusiasm and experience, and grow beyond just the local scene.  
  
I am helping out with the organization of the conference, which means a good chance to showcase other people. We are recruiting presenters, sponsors, and most importantly attendees! There will for sure be something for everyone, at all levels of experience.  
  
Here is what you should do:  
  
Want to attend? [Register now for the early bird price of $75](http://www.larubyconf.com/registration_information)  
Have something cool to talk about? [We want your proposal](http://www.larubyconf.com/speakers)  
Want to sponsor the conference? [Yes, we want you, click here](http://www.larubyconf.com/sponsors)  
  
We need your support, people. Let's have a great time, learn from each other, and make it a big success. 'Nuff said.
