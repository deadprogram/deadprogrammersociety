I read with great excitement that [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/), my favorite of the Ruby-centric hosting companies, was taking in a round of $3.5 million from [Benchmark Capital](http://www.benchmark.com/). I am a big fan of [Ezra](http://brainspl.at/), and the rest of the crew, and the whole waiting list thing for getting a new slice setup has been a big inhibitor of their growth.  
  
Funny, however, the press coverage has called EY a "Ruby on Rails hosting company". Yeah, sure, they are expert in RoR, no question. But the REAL stories there are [Merb](http://brainspl.at/) and [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/), and the press has not even caught a clue yet. Obviously Benchmark got it.  
  
Congratulations, guys!
