[![](http://www.hoborails.com/New%20web%20hobo.JPG)](http://www.hoborails.com/New%20web%20hobo.JPG)I am packing my stuff for [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/), and I am pretty excited. Last year's conference was the best event I had been to in years! The growth in the momentum and enthusiasm in the Rails community has only accelerated in the last year, and I am giddy at the prospect of more fun brain candy!  
  
I will be blogging from the conference, but not moment to moment like some quicker multitaskers. No, I prefer a more [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/) approach, giving a complete picture of relevance sometime after events have taken place. Well, I will try to stay focused, but relevant or not here I come.  
  
I was going to post my planned schedule for events I will be attending, but so is everyone else right now, and Dr. Nic's [MyConfPlan](http://myconfplan.com/) is down at the moment.. Also, I will at [Ezra'a Merb hackfest](http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/05/10/merb-hackfest-at-railsconf), and any parties I get invited to. Hint hint, all you companies hoping to sell me things, or sell me about things...feel free to try to influence me by buying me a beer.
