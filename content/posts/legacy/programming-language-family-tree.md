My colleague Michael Hocter just sent me a [great link](http://www.levenez.com/lang/history.html) to a diagram showing the history of the evolutions of the major programming languages. I just love this kind of visual representation of information!  
  
Note how C# has taken ideas from Java...then Java goes and draws inspiration from C#. Also note how C# 2.0 takes its inspiration from Ruby. The two programming languages that drew from the most other languages (five) were Oak, which turned into Java, and Ruby.
