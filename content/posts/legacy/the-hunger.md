Although I rarely read TechCrunch, for some reason my eye was attracted to the posting about the recent acceptance speech by Nobel laureate Doris Lessing.  
  
I could not disagree more with the analysis published on TechCrunch. I am very glad that I read the entire text of speech, as it is very inspiring. Rather than attacking the Internet, as Riley's superficial reading led him to believe, what Ms. Lessing was saying is rather more complex.  
  
I would in fact generally say that Riley's dismissing of the speech as "the ditherings of an ignorant old woman" indicates a rather shocking disrespect. Ms. Lessing may be many things, but I sincerely doubt that "ignorant" is one of them. So is it just link baiting, or indicative of something more sinister?  
  
The tendency to categorize anything that we do not agree with as "ignorant", is an unfortunate trademark of a fragmenting society of specialists who are not generally knowledgeable about anything that they do not already agree with. Hmmm, sounds exactly like what Ms. Lessing would decry, and Mr. Riley ignore.  
  
If anything, I understand what Ms. Lessing is saying, at least a little, when she posits on the carefree way we adopt wholeheartedly these new technologies and the social disruptions. But with each disruption comes beneficial changes. Not too many people would go back in their time machine to shoot Gutenberg, in order to avoid the horrors of twentieth century warfare. Because if you had, you would have seen even greater horrors from the lack of knowledge of disease control and pediatric health care.  
  
But am a technologist, and I look for technological solutions to problems. As such, it is a sobering read to understand the real challenges for OLPC are not technical, but social and economic. In a "school" with no books or supplies of any kind, because they have all been stolen long ago, how will the infrastructure needed for an information age survive a day, let alone a week?  
  
We ARE members of a spoiled and petulant culture of narcissists. But this is as it ever was. All of us are living in gutters, but some are looking at the stars indeed. Mr. Riley, please do not fall into that culture of ideocracy disguised as cultural democracy. And show a little respect for others.
