[![](http://www.greglasley.net/Images/Yellow-Garden-Spider-0001.jpg)](http://www.greglasley.net/Images/Yellow-Garden-Spider-0001.jpg)I enjoyed reading Phil Haack's little "you're either with us or against us" [diatribe from earlier today](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/24/bug-driven-development.aspx), where he rails against non-test-driven development. I only differ in that I prefer to call it Bug-Based Development (BBD).  
  
So are you one of those fifth-column types who is providing aid and comfort to the enemy? Draw a line in the sand... never make your troops take casualties retaking the same ground twice... [no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066206/).  
  
Give 'em hell, Phil!
