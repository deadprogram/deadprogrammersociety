I have been busy with several interesting code things I will be talking about soon, along with my family's annual trip to Spain (lots of good times, but no posting about that).  
  
Busy, yes. but not TOO busy to make my plans to go to [RubyConf 2008](http://www.rubyconf.org/). November in Florida, I can just imagine it now... hard core Ruby coding, jam sessions in the hotel, and maybe even some post-election riots. Plus roller disco. Damn, I'm there!  
  
And if you want to be there, better get it together and [register now](https://www.regonline.com/rubyconf2008).
