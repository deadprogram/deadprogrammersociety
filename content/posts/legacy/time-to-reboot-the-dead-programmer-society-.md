It has been too long, WAY too long, since my last entry. That means it is now time to reboot this blog in a new, better location. So what is this so-called "Dead Programmer Society", you may wonder?  
  
This site is dedicated to the Dead Programmers who dwell inside the corporate world. Not really so much dead, but slumbering.  
  
Wake up, wake up... and carpe codex!
