I just saw a really neat new gadget called "The Device Patented Process Indicating Apparatus " for the first time. Check it out at [http://www.processindicator.com/](http://www.processindicator.com/)  
  
It is a USB device that can be connected to take whatever data feed you desire, and use the "inscrutable dials", Ethereal Glowing Tube (EGT), and incandescent lamp on "The Device" to indicate whatever status you want. "The build is broken", "sales are up", or "there is a soccer game today" are only some of the neat automation possibilities that come to my mind without much effort.  
  
The only process indicating apparatus you'll ever need, indeed! Too bad they are not yet for sale...I want one of these! It is the coolest thing I have seen since the "Ambient Orb".
