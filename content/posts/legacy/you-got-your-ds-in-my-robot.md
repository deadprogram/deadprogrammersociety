[![](http://www.wanyrobotics.com/img/p_robots_silver.jpg)](http://www.wanyrobotics.com/img/p_robots_silver.jpg)The French press may be reeling in financial scandal, but the cool kids there are still concentrating on what is really important: drinking wine and [controlling an open source robot with a heavily modded Nintendo DS](http://gizmodo.com/352595/robot-mod-uses-nintendo-ds-touchscreen-microphone-for-controls).  
  
The [Pekee Mobile Robot](http://www.wanyrobotics.com/robots.html) and a whole bunch of DS hacking. That in itself just sounds like hours of fun. But then can you just imagine real-world robotic battles in your living room, fought remote controlled by DS. Can I preorder now?  
  
C'est Manifique!
