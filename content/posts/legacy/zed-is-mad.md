[![](http://www.movie-stuff.co.uk/acatalog/zedkey2sa.jpg)](http://www.movie-stuff.co.uk/acatalog/zedkey2sa.jpg)[Zed Shaw](http://www.zedshaw.com) has always been a rather curmudgeonly figure. I find him smart and hilarious, but of course many are rather insulted by his "tell it like he $%#@! well sees it" style. To me, Zed is like the [Hunter S. Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson) of our community. The more your believe your own BS, the more he pisses you off.  
  
Like Hunter S., Zed is a put up or shut up kind of person. Admit it, if you are reading this blog, you probably are running your vast empire on top of [his code](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/), while gleefully taking all credit yourself. But hey, Zed is just that kind of guy.  
  
He also reminds me of a guy I used to work with long ago, who among other things had a masterfully inventive style of invective that could, like Zed, "blister the paint off of a bulkhead". They both have sharp minds, with a very low tolerance for mental laxity. They also both play guitar.  
  
But one would be greatly mistaken to ignore the rant of such a mind, too easy to dismiss it as mere ravings. Zed chose to end his year with a [wide-ranging assault against the "Rails Ghetto"](http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html). It is a pretty interesting read... Are you afraid now to look? Perhaps you should be. But look anyhow. Then decide what you think.
