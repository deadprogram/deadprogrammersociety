[![](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~andrei/artagrafica/technical/la.jpg)](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~andrei/artagrafica/technical/la.jpg)The amazing [artistic visions](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~andrei/artagrafica/technical.htm) of computer science researcher [Andrei State](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~andrei/) combine both grace and utility. I am reminded of how I felt first seeing the original [Apple Knowledge Navigator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Navigator) video...a peek just around the corner into the future.  
  
Check out Andrei's [technical section](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~andrei/artagrafica/technical.htm) of the really neat ARTA GRAFICA website. Thank you to my friend Dan Rasmus and his cool ["Future of Information Work" blog](http://future-of-work.spaces.live.com/) for turning me on to this...
