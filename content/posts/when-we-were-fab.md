[![](http://www.fabathome.org/wiki/uploads/thumb/e/e8/IMG_0110.jpg/800px-IMG_0110.jpg)](http://www.fabathome.org/wiki/uploads/thumb/e/e8/IMG_0110.jpg/800px-IMG_0110.jpg)A fabber is a machine that can make three-dimensional objects just like a printer can print in two-dimensions on a a piece of paper. Only recently had this technology escaped the realm of science fiction into the still unreal world of government and large-budget research labs...which is ironic given that the purpose of fabbers is to produce highly specialized items at very low cost.  
Well, thanks to an [open-source hardware/software project called Fab@Home](http://www.fabathome.org), the technology is reaching out to the home enthusiast. You can now [make anything you want](http://www.fabathome.org/wiki/index.php?title=Democratize_innovation), as long as it is constructed of silicone, or perhaps [chocolate](http://www.fabathome.org/wiki/index.php?title=Materials:Chocolate).
