[![Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/images/aptana_ide_tag.gif "Aptana")](http://aptana.com)It was a couple of weeks ago when the RadRails team acknowledged that the ship had started to wander off course. Without any revenues, and with too few project contributors, the project was looking adrift. Could this be the end?  
  
Do not fear, gentle reader. Last week, the [announcement came at EclipseCon](http://www.crn.com/software/197801078) that the RadRails project is now part of the [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/) project. Up until this announcement, I had never heard of Aptana. What is this, I said. AJAX IDE, JavaScript debugging, support for every major JS library from the now ubiquitous [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) to my current personal favorite [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Of course I had to immediately download and install it, and try out the RadRails integration.  
  
Despite some initial hitches with the install that required a retry or two, and a [weird error message when opening RHTML files](http://www.aptana.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=761), I think that I will spend some more time with it to really put it thru its paces. I like what a good IDE can give you, and so am willing to put up with a bit to see if Aptana can deliver what it promises. I will be posting here with my results...
