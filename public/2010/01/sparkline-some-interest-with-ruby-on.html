      <h1>Sparkline Some Interest With Ruby on Rails<span class="dot">.</span></h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/29/62568004_cb569e408c.jpg" alt="">Recently, I added some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline">sparkline</a> graphs to a Ruby on Rails application. A sparkline is a very small graphic that displays a large amount of information, typically shown over time, and usually embedded in some other text. Invented by the father of modern infographics <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com">Edward Tufte</a>, the sparkline has become a fixture of many online applications that want to visually display some stats in a simple, integrated way.</p>
<p>When it come to adding sparklines into a Ruby on Rails application, there are a couple of different options. You can chart the data on the server, output being an image file. You can also chart the data on the client, with a couple of different JavaScript libraries as available options.</p>
<p>I started my plan, intending to implement my charts on the client-side. The project that appears to have the most flexibility, speed, and options, is an amazing jQuery plugin called <a href="http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/">jQuery Sparkline</a>. Unfortunately, the project to which I needed to add the sparklines is a bit older, and does not use jQuery. As a result, I was not able to use jQuery Sparkline for this current project.</p>
<p>Another interesting JavaScript sparkline library is <a href="http://github.com/lethain/sparklines.js">lethain&rsquo;s Sparkline.js</a>, but it has not been updated in some time, and is not compatible with current Internet Explorer versions. There is also an interesting looking newer lib <a href="http://github.com/topfunky/topfunky-sparkline-js">topfunky-sparkline-js</a> but I have not tried it out yet.</p>
<p>So that brings us to server-side sparkline generation. If you are using ImageMagick/RMagick then @topfunky once again provides, with the Ruby <a href="http://github.com/topfunky/sparklines">sparklines gem</a>. This gem provides lots of options for doing all sorts of fancy sparklines.</p>
<p>In my case, I am not using ImageMagick for anything else, so I did not want to install it just for this. What I really wanted was something much lighter-weight, and I was willing to accept a lot fewer options to get it.</p>
<p>It turns out that <a href="http://twitter.com/madrobby">madrobby</a> has written a library for generating very simple sparklines in pure Ruby code, called <a href="http://github.com/madrobby/spark_pr">spark_pr</a>. The project uses _why&rsquo;s pure Ruby implementation of a PNG generator to do the low-level work.</p>
<p>spark_pr has also spawned an interesting application of it from <a href="http://twitter.com/technoweenie">@technoweenie</a> called <a href="http://rack-sparklines.heroku.com/">Sparkplug</a>, which is a Rack module that generates spaklines from CSV data on the fly, using Rack handlers and Rack caching.</p>
<p>Once I had seen Sparkplug&rsquo;s minimal elegance, it seemed spark_pr was the option for me. I decided to incorporate spark_pr into my application. Given that the app was written with a dedicated approach to keeping a clean RESTful interface, and that the database already contained the time-series data, it was quite easy to incorporate. Here is what I had to do:</p>
<p>Step 1: Put spark_pr.rb file into lib directory. I just grabbed the code from the repo, and dropped it into my project. You may decide to have a more sophisticated way to do it, such as using git submodules.</p>
<p>Step 2:```
require &ldquo;spark_pr&rdquo;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">  
Step 3:```
include Spark
```in your controller  
  
Step 4: Add PNG format to controller action that was already returning my time-series data, and return the sparkline PNG data:  
  
Note that this controller action is already returning XML or JSON. PNG is just another format to be added, if you have a well-designed RESTful controller action.  
  
Step 5: Put image\_tag that requests the sparkline PNG image file into the view where you want it to appear, like this one:  
  
  
Voila! Refresh that view and you should now be looking at your ultra-hipster-chic sparkline graph. It is surprising how much more information comprehension a person has, when they are seeing a visual representation of their data. Plus it looks cool.</code></pre></div>
