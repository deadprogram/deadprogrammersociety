      <description>I had first heard of the PhoneGap open source framework for multiplatform mobile development last year at the FutureRuby conference in Toronto. Honestly, I did not really concentrate on all they were saying at the time, and in the flurry of info including back-to-back mobile sessions with Rhomobile, I did not fully retain a clear picture of what they had to offer. My bad.
It was not until late last year, while working on plans for a very cool mobile application, that I was reminded about PhoneGap by one of my colleagues.</description>
