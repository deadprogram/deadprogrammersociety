      <description>I have just begun a new blog called Net Grommit.
It is a place that I can go off and explore my experiences with technology and being a 21st century parent. I will get into anything from video games, kids programming, tech toys, education, and whatever else appeals to me. As a father of two boys, and an obsessive technologist, I have plenty of personal experience to talk about, and I really look forward to the participation of some other people, as well.</description>

      <description>I was taking my morning constitutional with my youngest son, when I noticed my neighbor who programs at JPL had added a new placard to the artistic decor attached to his fence.
And who says there is no software development in Los Angeles?</description>
