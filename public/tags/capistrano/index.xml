      <description>I read Jamis Buck&amp;rsquo;s posting late last night, about how he was retiring from involvement with Capistrano, Net:SSH and a few other closely related projects. First of all, the community owes him a lot for doing so much work on these crucial parts of the Ruby on Rails ecosystem.
Seems like he has fallen victim to his own project&amp;rsquo;s popularity. So many people using your code, and they start to expect things, and then demand them.</description>
