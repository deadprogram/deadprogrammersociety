      <description>I do not often pay full attention to Giles Bowkett. That is the flip side of being the provocateur that he is, some people will occasionally tune out. However, when anyone plays the Steve Krug card, I am compelled to take a look.
Yesterday, Giles posted a dead-on point about user registration, called &amp;ldquo;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Care About Your Hoops&amp;rdquo;. When you compare the success of simplicity, as in the Google and Apple examples, to what we all tend to fall into, I hope you are as embarrassed as I was.</description>

      <description>Last night was the always fun Los Angeles web application developer Meetup, this time at AOL in Beverly Hills. After navigating a veritable maze of cubes, we found ourselves in a fairly large screening room chock full of AV equipment, accompanied by a large pile of pizza boxes. A few moments later, the throng of LA-based developers shuffled in, ready for the latest and greatest. The prerequisites fulfilled, we got down to some serious techno-babble.</description>

      <title>Getting To Usable</title>

      <description>I read a great posting last night from Matt Rogers, founder of startup Aroxo, on a strategy for usability testing. Suddenly, I was flashing back a few years to the early salad days of web usability&amp;hellip;
When I first read Steve Krug&amp;rsquo;s tiny masterwork &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Make Me Think&amp;rdquo;, I was very excited; at last, a nice practical approach! After the pedantic and overly academic work of guys like Jakob Neilson, Krug&amp;rsquo;s book hit me like Dr.</description>

      <title>I Want My API</title>

      <description>I just ran into a really great resource for open source API documentation. Called gotAPI, it links in a delightfully searchable way all of the APIs we love, but turn out to not actually know. Well, we know them, just not well enough to have their numbers setup for speed dial on our cell phones. Or our code able to call them directly without looking up a reference first.
Here is a small sample of ones I will actually use regularly:</description>

      <title>The Eyes Have It</title>

      <description>Software usability has really benefited from the latest and greatest digital technology for eye tracking. If you are not familiar with eye tracking, it is exactly what it sounds like: a camera watching where the user&amp;rsquo;s eyes are focused, and matching that to the screen to identify what the user is REALLY looking at, for how long, and in what order.
Here is a really great summary called &amp;ldquo;Scientific Web Design: 23 Actionable Lessons from Eye-Tracking Studies&amp;rdquo; that collects information from several different studies, and packages it up into something pretty, dare I say it, usable.</description>

      <title>Sinatra, a Ruby web framework, and Why It Matters</title>

      <description>As followers of this blog know, I am very interested in the Ruby language itself, not just web development. But it is undeniable that Ruby has become popular largely due to web development powered by Ruby on Rails. However amazing Rails is, however, it is not the final web framework to be developed in Ruby.
When Ari Lerner first told me of the Sinatra project, I was interested to see where he was going with it.</description>

      <title>More Developer Fun In Los Angeles</title>

      <description>Last night was the always entertaining Los Angeles Application Developer Meetup. L.A. is not known for the same massive quantity of developers as the bay area, for example, but having joined forces with the LA Ruby on Rails Meetup crew some time back, the monthly event is still growing.
This month&amp;rsquo;s was held at the impressive new digs of YellowPages.com, who have been busy building out a huge Ruby on Rails based local search replacement for their venerable 100K+ lines of Java code.</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday night was July&amp;rsquo;s Los Angeles Web Application Developer Meetup. This event is starting to get really good. Not only were there lots of people who came out, but our hosts Yahoo! actually bought us beer too. Hint to future hosts of the meetup&amp;hellip; be cool like Yahoo! and provide BOTH a projection screen and beer.
There were two especially fun presentations, at least to me. Jim Bumgardner of Yahoo showed off some of his really interesting web gadgetry.</description>
