      <description>I keep thinking about Zed Shaw&amp;rsquo;s vitriolic (and newly updated) posting, and one particular aspect about it that seems to bother me. One way of looking at a ghetto is that is keeps people in. Another, is that is keeps outsiders away. In either case, it is an economy, like most any other. And like any economy, there are winners and losers.
What exactly is Zed complaining about? That the overall level of technical competence is very low, even among many self-proclaimed developers?</description>

      <description>The continued rise of the individual as a viable economic unit is being covered by several bloggers, starting with Paul Kedrosky and continuing with Tim O&amp;rsquo;Reily.
The trend in human societies has been toward increasing decentralization. We see this in terms of computers (70&amp;rsquo;s = mainframes, 80&amp;rsquo;s = PCs, 90&amp;rsquo;s = Internet, 2000&amp;rsquo;s = Wireless Internet), as well as in terms of business (70&amp;rsquo;s = corporate HQ, 80&amp;rsquo;s = independent business units, 90&amp;rsquo;s = spin-off independent companies, 2000&amp;rsquo;s = supply chain integration).</description>
