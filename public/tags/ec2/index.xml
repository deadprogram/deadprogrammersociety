      <description>This last weekend, we completed migration of a slightly more complex Ruby on Rails application than the usual to Engine Yard&amp;rsquo;s EY-Cloud. It took a few tries, and a tiny bit of research, before we completely understood what to do to get it up and running with all of the needed capabilities. Naturally this was due to gaps in my own knowledge, and I wanted to post about what I had learned, and how awesome EY-Cloud really is!</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL on Ubuntu on EC2: Backing It All Up</title>
      <link>/2009/10/postgresql-on-ubuntu-on-ec2-backing-it.html</link>

      <description>This post continues what I started with &amp;ldquo;PostgreSQL on Ubuntu on EC2: The Installation Guide&amp;rdquo;. Once you have your PostgreSQL database server instance running, you will need to backup two different things: your database data, and the instance itself. The database data will be backed up using Elastic Block Storage (EBS) snapshots. Once we have the instance running the backups correctly, we will then create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that will allow you to launch a new instance to replace the database server in case it goes down.</description>

      <description>For some time, I have had clients hosting a couple different applications on Amazon EC2 using Ubuntu. One of these apps uses PostgreSQL, and has been running without event for quite a while. Yesterday, I got to catch up for lost time, by spending the entire day wrestling with data recovery issues related to a failed apt-get upgrade on an important database server. Luckily, the awesome Eric Hammond was around on IRC, came to my rescue, and coached my thru my self-inflicted pain.</description>

      <description>Last night was the always fun Los Angeles web application developer Meetup, this time at AOL in Beverly Hills. After navigating a veritable maze of cubes, we found ourselves in a fairly large screening room chock full of AV equipment, accompanied by a large pile of pizza boxes. A few moments later, the throng of LA-based developers shuffled in, ready for the latest and greatest. The prerequisites fulfilled, we got down to some serious techno-babble.</description>

      <description>This last week has brought some very nice and favorable attention to the Dead Programmer Society.
The ever-popular &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d Rather be A Jazz Programmer&amp;rdquo; post popped up again, this time in the stodgy old school publication Computerworld. They ran an article on the &amp;ldquo;Rock Star Programmer&amp;rdquo; meme, and decided that my little post was part of the &amp;ldquo;Kill Rock Stars&amp;rdquo; contrarian perspective they were looking for. Thanks for making me look so good, guys!</description>

      <description>A few weeks back, I indulged my current obsession with grid computing, and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s EC2 and S3 services in particular, with a lengthy post. I mentioned how friend Ari Lerner and I had built a really neat solution, and were going to put all of our processing farm goodness into a nice neat gemified package. Well, mostly thanks to Ari, we now have a new Ruby gem called ProcessorPool that uses EC2 and S3 to do all the hard work for you.</description>

      <title>On The Grid With EC2</title>

      <description>Lately, I have had a chance to get seriously into Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. I doubt any reader of this blog is unfamiliar with the existence of EC2, but many of you have probably not even gotten to the tire kicking stage, like I had been until recently.
Even after attending several sessions about Amazon&amp;rsquo;s EC2 at RailsConf 2007, I still had only a very general idea about the service.</description>
