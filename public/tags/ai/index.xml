      <description>I have never been a big checkers fan. Good thing, cause I would have had to give up the game after the recent &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; of the game by a team of Canadian computer scientists. Every possible move of every possible game has been mapped, and a checkers playing program can take each of these into account before deciding on its next move. No human player has such ability.
Actually, as it turns out, the best possible outcome in a game of checkers, given two players who each make perfect moves, is a draw.</description>

      <description>Jeff Atwood at the Coding Horror blog links to a great introduction to Bayes&#39; Theorem.
If indeed as has been claimed &amp;ldquo;Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses the if statement,&amp;quot; we should all be well versed in the work of the mysterious Reverend Bayes&amp;hellip;
I have been playing around intermittently with an interesting application of Bayesian classification for a couple of years. Perhaps this will inspire me to actually finish it up enough to put it up on the web.</description>
