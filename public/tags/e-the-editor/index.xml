      <description>I love it when I find out about a cool new tool. In this case, it is E, a Windows clone of the ubiquitous Mac text editor TextMate. Looks like this project has been around for awhile, but I just heard of it thanks to a blog entry about creating a Mac-like environment under Windows.
Installing E is not a small task, although it is not a difficult one. This is due to the fact that E relies heavily on Cygwin to support &amp;ldquo;bundles&amp;rdquo; which is how TextMate creates their oh-so-useful macro and template collections.</description>
