      <description>I had read with mild amusement the minor dustup over the craze of Werewolf players at RubyConf 2007. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, you can read about it here.
Some people just really enjoy playing social games. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them the Werewolves&amp;hellip; you know who you are, even if the rest of us do not.
Other people, however, view RubyConf as a place to get together with the other commiters on their beloved project, stay up all night, and crank out a new release before their presentation the next day.</description>
