      <description>Security expert Bruce Schneier says not to use Windows Vista, due to the flaws of the Digital Rights Management (DRM) incorporated into the OS. No, really. One of, if not THE, top security expert says not to use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s newest OS.
To quote Mr. Schneier:
 Windows Vista includes an array of &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; that you don&amp;rsquo;t want. These features will make your computer less reliable and less secure. They&amp;rsquo;ll make your computer less stable and run slower.</description>

It was during the reign of Jobs the First, and all was well with the world. Except for the installed base of Macs, and trying to sell businesses on buying Macs. Shareholder were incensed, board members impatient.
Even after the coup, and various poorly executed attempts to rectify the situation by the imposters Scully and Gassee could not change, and the kingdom was greatly endangered.</description>
