      <description>Yo, Gabba! Gabba, hey? Gabba is a Ruby gem to do easy server-side Google Analytics tracking of page view and custom events. Gather around and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how it works.
Google Analytics is the gold standard of website traffic reporting. In addition to tracking page views, one of the interesting capabilities it has is to track custom events. These could be shopping cart checkouts or video plays from clicking on a button in a Flash player.</description>

      <title>I Think I&#39;m Comatose</title>

      <description>This last weekend, I upgraded a pretty complex application to the latest Ruby on Rails, and consequently had to upgrade a bunch of the plugins. In the case of Comatose 2.0, this was well timed, as there is a new release.
If you have never heard of Comatose, it is a very cool mini-CMS that you add to your Rails app as a plugin. For cases where you have an applcation, and you want to put the &amp;lsquo;static&amp;rsquo; pages under the control of the users, while still integrating with your application, Comatose is the best option I have discovered.</description>

      <title>I Want My API</title>

      <description>I just ran into a really great resource for open source API documentation. Called gotAPI, it links in a delightfully searchable way all of the APIs we love, but turn out to not actually know. Well, we know them, just not well enough to have their numbers setup for speed dial on our cell phones. Or our code able to call them directly without looking up a reference first.
Here is a small sample of ones I will actually use regularly:</description>

      <title>Money In The Ghetto</title>

      <description>I keep thinking about Zed Shaw&amp;rsquo;s vitriolic (and newly updated) posting, and one particular aspect about it that seems to bother me. One way of looking at a ghetto is that is keeps people in. Another, is that is keeps outsiders away. In either case, it is an economy, like most any other. And like any economy, there are winners and losers.
What exactly is Zed complaining about? That the overall level of technical competence is very low, even among many self-proclaimed developers?</description>

      <title>Sinatra, a Ruby web framework, and Why It Matters</title>

      <description>As followers of this blog know, I am very interested in the Ruby language itself, not just web development. But it is undeniable that Ruby has become popular largely due to web development powered by Ruby on Rails. However amazing Rails is, however, it is not the final web framework to be developed in Ruby.
When Ari Lerner first told me of the Sinatra project, I was interested to see where he was going with it.</description>

      <title>More Developer Fun In Los Angeles</title>

      <description>Last night was the always entertaining Los Angeles Application Developer Meetup. L.A. is not known for the same massive quantity of developers as the bay area, for example, but having joined forces with the LA Ruby on Rails Meetup crew some time back, the monthly event is still growing.
This month&amp;rsquo;s was held at the impressive new digs of YellowPages.com, who have been busy building out a huge Ruby on Rails based local search replacement for their venerable 100K+ lines of Java code.</description>

      <title>RailsConf 2007 - Day 2</title>

      <description>After the incredible energy of RailsConf Day 1, Day 2 seemed to slow down the pace a little bit. That was good for me, as I could spend some time catching up with friends both old and new, and not just attending sessions like an information junky. First would come the morning keynote speeches from Cyndi Mitchell of ThoughtWorks, and headliner Tim Bray of Sun Microsystems, with a short interlude from Charles Nutter.</description>

      <description>The last week or so I have been very busy playing with and setting up my new MacBook Pro. This is, in fact, my first post from it. After spending some time with it, I have to say that I am still extremely pleased! I have my Ruby on Rails environment all setup and working spendidly. I have my primary dev toolset CocoaMySQL, Locomotive, TextMate, and SVNx and now everything is pretty dialed in.</description>

      <description>Portland has good beer. There, now I&amp;rsquo;ve said it. One of the key benefits of holding the RailsConf 2007 conference in Portland has to be easily obtaining really good beer.
The McMenamins on Broadway is the closest place to the convention center to go where &amp;ldquo;Classics such as raspberry-tinged Ruby, medium-bodied Hammerhead and dark, strong Terminator Stout are always available.&amp;rdquo;
In between the fun of learning all about Rails 2.0, Capistrano 2.</description>

      <description>I just checked my email, and saw that registration has just opened for RailsConf 2007. I went to last year&amp;rsquo;s conference, and it was the most interesting and exciting event in the software industry I had been to in years!
If you are interested in going, I suggest that you register immediately. Last year&amp;rsquo;s event sold out in a couple days. When they added 100 additional spots last year, those sold out in hours!</description>

      <title>Merb Is The Word</title>

      <description>I have been playing around with Merb, which is a very cool project from Ezra Zygmuntowicz. Merb combines the Mongrel web server with a lightweight Ruby web framework. It has way less stuff in it than Rails, but is somewhat more than Camping.
Where this all started, was that I was looking for some way to use Mongrel to create a new REST web service for a client. This service has no UI, and basically just needs to front end a Ruby DSL that I have been working on.</description>
