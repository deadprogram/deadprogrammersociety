      <description>Archimedes was a very cool dude. When you think of inventor/intellectuals these days, we have been trained to imagine a fairly wimpy, bookish kind of person. Not so for Archie, he was also a bad-ass who defended his beloved city of Syracuse to the death at the hands of Roman invaders. Archimedes invented what for the day, were some freaky advanced technologies.
Well, new information has been discovered about him, thanks to the painstaking work by Will Noel at the Walters Art Museum of New York.</description>

      <description>Jeff Atwood at the Coding Horror blog links to a great introduction to Bayes&#39; Theorem.
If indeed as has been claimed &amp;ldquo;Google uses Bayesian filtering the way Microsoft uses the if statement,&amp;quot; we should all be well versed in the work of the mysterious Reverend Bayes&amp;hellip;
I have been playing around intermittently with an interesting application of Bayesian classification for a couple of years. Perhaps this will inspire me to actually finish it up enough to put it up on the web.</description>
