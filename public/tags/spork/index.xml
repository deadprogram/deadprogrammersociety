      <description>Everyone wants it all. In the case of upload processing, this means we want both the convenience of Sinatra coding, plus the performance that a nice process/threading model gives us.

If you are using Passenger, it already is buffering your uploads, and not calling your Sinatra application until the upload is complete.</description>
