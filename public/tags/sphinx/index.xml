      <description>My client was having troubles. The site was crashing, seemingly at random. QA was baffled, management concerned. After hunting thru logs, the culprit was found: the ferret search service.
Despite having configured acts_as_ferret to use the DRb server option, the &amp;ldquo;whole thing&amp;rdquo; would fall apart on a regular basis whenever the ferret daemon would crash&amp;hellip; which was pretty often. The ruby on rails plugin acts_as_ferret would revert to a local mode of operation, which would only make matters worse when competing mongrels would corrupt the index files on disk.</description>
