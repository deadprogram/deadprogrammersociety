      <title>Crossing The PhoneGap For Multiplatform Mobile Applications</title>

      <description>I had first heard of the PhoneGap open source framework for multiplatform mobile development last year at the FutureRuby conference in Toronto. Honestly, I did not really concentrate on all they were saying at the time, and in the flurry of info including back-to-back mobile sessions with Rhomobile, I did not fully retain a clear picture of what they had to offer. My bad.
It was not until late last year, while working on plans for a very cool mobile application, that I was reminded about PhoneGap by one of my colleagues.</description>

      <description>I have been using git for a while, not quite as long as the really cool kids, but long enough to have become a git snob. As such, having to work on existing projects that were using that nasty old subversion was just like, a drag, man.
I kept saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to migrate everything over to git.&amp;rdquo; Somehow, I just never seemed to find the time. Another little problem was the underwhelming level of support for git on Windows.</description>
