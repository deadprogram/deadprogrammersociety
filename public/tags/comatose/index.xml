      <description>This last weekend, I upgraded a pretty complex application to the latest Ruby on Rails, and consequently had to upgrade a bunch of the plugins. In the case of Comatose 2.0, this was well timed, as there is a new release.
If you have never heard of Comatose, it is a very cool mini-CMS that you add to your Rails app as a plugin. For cases where you have an applcation, and you want to put the &amp;lsquo;static&amp;rsquo; pages under the control of the users, while still integrating with your application, Comatose is the best option I have discovered.</description>
