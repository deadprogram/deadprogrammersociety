      <description>Jim Weirich is a very smart guy. So smart that his presentation was not about complicated classes, but about Ruby itself and how to take advantage of it to simplify things. Jim&amp;rsquo;s background in computing is long and varied, something like a history lesson in programming languages. Here is the abbreviated list:
FORTRAN &amp;gt; C &amp;gt; Modula 2 &amp;gt; C++ &amp;gt; Eiffel &amp;gt; Java
and in parallel to this:
LISP &amp;gt; FORTH &amp;gt; TCL &amp;gt; Perl</description>

      <description>I remember Marcel Molina from the first RailsConf, when the Rails core team was introduced to the audience. What had impressed me at the time, besides his cool glasses, was the fact that Marcel comes from a literature background.
That makes his take on programming in Ruby very interesting, because he approaches it from an aesthetic perspective, not just a functional one. To Marcel, code must achieve both, for it to be considered beautiful.</description>
