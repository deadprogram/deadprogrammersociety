      <description>We had made incredible strides forward in our construction of &amp;ldquo;Rogue 1&amp;rdquo; our autonomous blimp that we are building as the first implementation of flying_robot, our Arduino-framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles based on top of Ruby Arduino Development (RAD).

We inflated our envelope, and my brother attached the gondola that he has been carefully constructing.</description>
