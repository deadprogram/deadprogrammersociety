      <description>Software patents&amp;hellip; as, Obi-Wan warned, &amp;ldquo;You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.&amp;rdquo; Well, the dark side has struck back, people. A massive salvo has been launched, this time aimed directly at the open source community in the form of Trend Micro vs. Barracuda Networks.
I was thinking about a cute little pictograph that would describe the public awareness and attitudes about software patents.</description>

      <description>Was Thomas Edison the world&amp;rsquo;s first patent troll, or at least the most famous? Fortune&amp;rsquo;s Business Innovation Insider displays a list of the &amp;ldquo;nine things Edison never actually invented.&amp;rdquo; In case you were wondering, yes, Edison did sue rivals to enforce his patents.
Just for fun, compare the lives of Edison and his great rival Nikola Tesla. Edison was everything that Tesla was not. In particular, financially successful. However Tesla really was a great inventor.</description>

      <description>Paul Kedrosky comments on the latest travesty in the abusive system that we use here in the US for &amp;ldquo;protecting&amp;rdquo; intellectual property related to computer software.
As someone who gets paid by creating IP, I am supposed to support the US patent system, right? But I cannot help but think, what if the attitude of the early innovators in software had been like that of the current industry? How would have kids like me grown up hacking the Apple ][ using the published source code of its ROM?</description>
